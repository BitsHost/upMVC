        You can insert a file.php here that can be automatically updated using a tool from a separate user.
        If you want developers to be able to extend your system. All users should be able to edit file.php.
        Following that, you may construct a class for all users. When the class is run, a new module is added to file.php.
        file.php content e.g.:

        $newModule = new myNewModuleRoutes();
        $newModule->Routes($router);
